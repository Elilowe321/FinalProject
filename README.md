# FinalProject
Our Project uses SFML to to display a simple UI which takes in input for certain parameters related to a cars specifications. 
We then use the parameters, along with the wieght of each parameter to sort a dataset of cars based on those 
parameters to find the most suitble car for a partifulcar user.

We will use two sorting algorithms to find the most suitable car.
The sorting algorithms used are: (Find 2 sorting algorithms).
